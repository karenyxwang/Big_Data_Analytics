        "For this assignment, we will focus on introducing you to hierarchical data stored in dataframes, graph data and traversing relationships among data. you will learn to use pandasql (cause Pandas are the our favorite animal and data science tool 🐼) and Spark. You will be using spark locally and not really on a cluster for this homework. The next homework will unleash the full power of Spark by deploying it on a cluster.\n",

It's pinned on Piazza and us TA's work really hard to keep it updated with everything you might need to know or anything we might have failed to specify. Writing these HWs and test cases gets tricky since students always end up implementing solutions that we did not anticipate and thus could not have prepared the grader correcty for.\n",
        "\n",
        "It makes us really sad to tell you that you should've read the FAQ when you come to office hours or post on piazza saying that you've been stuck one part for a really long time. It'll also make you sad when you realize the answer was already sitting there in the FAQ. Please, read it. Also, please read the directions carefully!\n"

        "## Getting Started with Apache Spark\n",
        "\n",
        "Apache Spark, which has become the de facto successor to Apache Hadoop, is a complex, cluster-based data processing system that was written in Scala.  It leverages a wide variety of distributed tools and components used for big data processing.  It interfaces “smoothly” to Python, but be forewarned that there are some rough edges.  For those interested in why, there are a few reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Scala has slightly different notions of types (especially things like Rows) and handles missing values (nulls) differently from Python.\n",
        "* The Scala-based Spark “engine” can’t just run Python functions as it’s doing data processing.  This means that you want to be careful to use Spark’s library of functions, or the special mechanisms for inserting “user defined functions.”\n",
        "* DataFrames on Spark are “sharded,” so there is no single object corresponding to the DataFrame!\n",
        "\n",
        "While Spark DataFrames try to emulate the same programming style as Pandas DataFrames, there are some differences in how you express things.  Please refer to the Lecture Slides for our take on the differences.  You may also find the following Web pages to be useful resources for understanding Spark vs Pandas DataFrames:\n",
        "\n",
        "https://lab.getbase.com/pandarize-spark-dataframes/\n",
        "https://ogirardot.wordpress.com/2015/07/31/from-pandas-to-apache-sparks-dataframe/ \n",
        "\n",
        "For this assignment, we are going to get familiar with Spark without worrying too much about sharding and distribution.  We are going to run Spark on your Docker container.  This isn’t really using it to its strengths -- and in fact you might find Spark to be unexpectedly slow -- but it will get you comfortable with programming in Spark without worrying about distributed nodes, clusters, and spending real dollars on the cloud.  Your code, if written properly, will “naturally scale” to clusters running on the Cloud.  Later in the term we’ll connect your Jupyter instance to Spark running on the cloud -- to handle “truly big data.”\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Initializing a Connection to Spark\n",
        "\n",
        "We'll open a connection to Spark as follows. Note that Spark has multiple interfaces, as you will see if you look at sample code elsewhere. `SparkSession` is the “most modern” one and we’ll be using it for this course.  From `SparkSession`, you can load data into Spark DataFrames as well as `RDD`s.\n",

        "**A very brief review of graph theory**. Recall that a graph $G$ is composed of a set of vertices $V$ (also called nodes) and edges $E$ (sometimes called links).  Each vertex $v \\in V$ has an identity (often represented in the real world as a string or numeric “node ID”).  Each edge $e \\in E$ is a tuple $(v_i,v_j)$ where $v_i$ represents the source or origin of the edge, and $v_j$ represents the target or destination.  In the simplest case, the edge tuple above is simply the pair $(v_i,v_j)$ but in many cases we may have additional fields such as a label or a distance.  Recall also that graphs may be undirected or directed; in undirected graphs, all edges are symmetric whereas in directed graphs, they are not.  For instance, airline flights are directed, whereas Facebook friend relationships are undirected.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let’s read our social graph data from Yelp, which forms a directed graph.  Here, the set of nodes is also not specified; the assumption is that the only nodes that matter are linked to other nodes, and thus their IDs will appear in the set of edges.  To load the file `input.txt` into a Spark DataFrame, you can use lines like the following.\n",

        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "We’ll use the suffix `_sdf` to represent “Spark DataFrame,” much as we used `_df` to denote a Pandas DataFrame in Homework 1.  Load the various files from Yelp.\n",
        "\n",
        "Your datasets should be named `yelp_business_sdf`, `yelp_business_attributes_sdf`, `yelp_check_in_sdf`, `yelp_reviews_sdf`, and `yelp_users_sdf`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Submit the first 75 entries of the yelp_business_sdf to the autograder as a pandas dataframe by using the toPandas() function to convert it from a spark dataframe to a normal dataframe. Also,\n",
        " make sure to sort it by the \"name\" column in ascending order"

In each iteration or round up to depth `d`, it explores the set of all new nodes directly connected to the nodes it already has seen, before going on to the nodes another “hop” away.  If we do this correctly, we will explore the graph in a way that (1) avoids getting caught in cycles or loops, and (2) visits each node in the fewest number of “hops” from the origin.  BFS is commonly used in tasks such as friend recommendation in social networks.\n",
